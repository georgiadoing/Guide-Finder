Being updated (Summer 2023) with further development to use for selecting PAMless guides. 

These updates, found in GuideFinder_Mac_2020_SMM_PAMless, allows for a selection of 
NGG, NAN, or NNN PAM sites for guide design. There are also some small fixes and 
streamlining to guide filtering, as well as additional output files. No changes were 
made to the pre-processing script.


# Guide-Finder
Pan-bacterial, genome-wide guide designer 


README: The Guide Finder program is designed to select guides targeting genes in any 
bacterial species. Draft genome annotations may be used for guide design, but must be pre-processed to format
properly prior into input into the Guide Finder program (a pre-processing script is provided). 
See the Protocols folder for more information on how to run the program. Instructions for 
the use of both complete and draft genome annotations is provided in this folder. Example 
exercises for the use of either a complete or draft genome annotation have also been 
provided (see respective folders). It is highly recommended that users read through these
provided protocols and work through the exercises prior to use of either the 
pre-processing or the Guide Finder scripts.
